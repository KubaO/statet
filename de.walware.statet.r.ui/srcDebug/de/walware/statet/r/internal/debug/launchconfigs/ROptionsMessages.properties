ROption_version_description = Print version information to standard output and exit successfully.
ROption_save_description = Data sets are saved at the end of the R session.
ROption_no-save_description = Data sets are not saved at the end of the R session.
ROption_no-environ_description = Do not read any user file to set environment variables.
ROption_no-site-file_description = Do not read the site-wide profile at startup.
ROption_no-init-file_description = Do not read the user''s profile at startup.
ROption_restore_description = Saved images (file ''.RData'' in the directory where R was started) should be restored at startup.
ROption_no-restore_description = Implies all the ''--no-restore-*'' options.
ROption_no-restore-data_description = Saved images (file ''.RData'' in the directory where R was started) should not be restored at startup.
ROption_vanilla_description = Combine ''--no-save'', ''--no-environ'', ''--no-site-file'', ''--no-init-file'' and ''--no-restore''.
ROption_no-readline_description = Turn off command-line editing via readline. This is useful when running R from within Emacs using the ess package.
ROption_ess_description = Set Rterm up for use by R-inferior-mode in ess.
ROption_min-vsize_description = Specify the minimum amount of memory used for variable size objects by setting the "vector heap" size, spezified by the argument (unit: bytes; ''G''=2^30, ''M''=2^20, ''K''=2^10, ''k''=1000).
ROption_max-vsize_description = Specify the maximum amount of memory used for variable size objects by setting the "vector heap" size, spezified by the argument (unit: bytes; ''G''=2^30, ''M''=2^20, ''K''=2^10, ''k''=1000).
ROption_min-nsize_description = Specify the minimum amount of memory used for fixed size objects by setting the number of "cons cells", spezified by the argument (unit: number; ''G''=2^30, ''M''=2^20, ''K''=2^10, ''k''=1000; A cons cell takes 28 bytes on a 32-bit machine, and usually 56 bytes on a 64-bit machine).
ROption_max-nsize_description = Specify the maximum amount of memory used for fixed size objects by setting the number of "cons cells", spezified by the argument (unit: number; ''G''=2^30, ''M''=2^20, ''K''=2^10, ''k''=1000; A cons cell takes 28 bytes on a 32-bit machine, and usually 56 bytes on a 64-bit machine).
ROption_max-ppsize_description = Specify the maximum size of the pointer protection stack as n locations, spezified by the argument (default=10000, max=100000).
ROption_max-mem-size_description = Specify a limit for the amount of memory to be used both for R objects and working areas, spezified by the argument (default=min(1024Mb, amount of physical RAM), min=16Mb).
ROption_quiet_description = Do not print out the initial copyright and welcome messages.
ROption_slave_description = Make R run as quietly as possible. This option is intended to support programs which use R to compute results for them.
ROption_verbose_description = Print more information about progress, and in particular set R''s option verbose to TRUE. R code uses this option to control the printing of diagnostic messages.
ROption_debugger_description = Run R through debugger name. Note that in this case, further command line options are disregarded, and should instead be given when starting the R executable from inside the debugger.
ROption_gui_description = Use type as graphical user interface (note that this also includes interactive graphics). Currently, possible values for type are ''X11'' (the default), ''gnome'' provided that gnome support is available, and ''none''.
ROption_args_description = This flag does nothing except cause the rest of the command line to be skipped: this can be useful to retrieve values from it with commandArgs().

REnvVariable_ENVIRON.description=The name of the site file is the one pointed to.
REnvVariable_PAPERSIZE.description=The default paper size.
REnvVariable_RPRINTCMD.description=The default print command.
REnvVariable_LIBS.description=Specifies the list of R library trees searched for add-on packages.
REnvVariable_PROFILE.description=The name of the site-wide startup profile
REnvVariable_USER.description=The name of users "home directory".
